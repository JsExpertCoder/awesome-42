# Contributing to [awesome-42](https://github.com/leeoocca/)

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a issue
- Discussing the current contents of the list
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new sections
- Becoming a curator

## Proposing changes

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
1. Make the changes following the formatting guidelines.
1. If you've changed the sections structure, update the <abbr title="Table of Contents">TOC</abbr>.
1. Issue that pull request!

## Formatting Guidelines

When proposing changes, be sure to adhere to the following formatting:

```md
<!-- Link with description -->
- [Title](https://url) - Description.

<!-- Link without description -->
- [Title](https://url)
```

- Adding a description is always preferrable, especially if the link contents can't be guessed from the context of the section.
- `https` is preferrable for the URL when possible.
- Indentation is always done with tabs.

## Updating your <abbr title="Pull Request">PR</abbr>

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, here is a guide on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.

## Discussions

We’re using Discussions as a place to connect with other members of our community. We hope that you:

- Share ideas.
- Engage with other community members.
- Welcome others and are open-minded.
